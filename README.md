# AI Planning and Integration Agent

This repository contains an AI-based agent framework for planning and integration using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model. The agent uses two main components: a planning agent and an integration agent. It also incorporates a response checker to ensure the generated responses meet specific requirements.

## Features

- **Planning Agent**: Generates plans based on user queries and tool specifications.
- **Integration Agent**: Integrates outputs from tools and plans to provide comprehensive responses.
- **Response Checker**: Validates the responses to ensure relevance, coherence, and completeness.
- **Configurable**: Easily configurable using a YAML file.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for API requests and response validation.
